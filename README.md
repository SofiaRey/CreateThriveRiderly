## 🤐 Caveats

Because of a matter of time, I had to prioritize tasks and I was not able to make everything as I wanted to.

- Navbar is not fully responsive
- Client won't be able to open a HTML file in their browsers, but instead, I deployed the app to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). [Link to see the web](https://create-thrive-riderly-sofia-rey.vercel.app/)
- There are no React components
- I had barely knoweldge of Bootstrap and because of this, I probably didn't use as many Boostrap classes as possible.

# 📃 Documentation

1. This project started with using a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
2. After that, I installed the required libraries which were: [bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap) and [react-bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap).
3. I started to code the page for the desktop version because of the given design.
4. Then, I started to implement the mobile version just making the design responsive as I pleased.
5. After that, I created [this Github repo](https://github.com/SofiaRey/CreateThriveRiderly).
6. Almost at the end, I creted a [Vercel project](https://create-thrive-riderly-sofia-rey.vercel.app/) that deploys a new version of the app each time I make a push to the `main` branch.
7. Last but not least, I pushed all the progress made to this repo.
